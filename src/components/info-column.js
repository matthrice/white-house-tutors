            <p>The language you speak growing up affects the way you see the world. The same is true for learning computer langauges.</p>
            <p>To learn a language takes more than knowing where to put the nouns and verbs, how to conjugate. It requires <b>understanding</b> the structure behind sentences.</p>
            <p>At <b>White House Tutors</b>, we help the student understand the paradigms behind coding rather than the language itself. Through one-on-one sessions, you'll learn computer science the right way to benefit your studies in years to come.</p>
            <p>WH Tutors is geared towards students in <b>EECS 183</b>, <b>EECS 203</b> and <b>EECS 280</b>, but we will consider tutoring for other courses as well.</p>
